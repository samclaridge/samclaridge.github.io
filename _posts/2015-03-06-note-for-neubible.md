If you’re not already in the know, just a few weeks ago, a brilliant new app launched to minor fanfare. The NeuBible app [available for iPhone ](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/neubible/id961857426?mt=8 "target="_blank)has been more than a long time coming. Created by [Aaron Martin](https://twitter.com/iamaaronmartin "target="_blank), designer at Yahoo, and [Kory Westerhold](https://twitter.com/iamkory "target="_blank), product designer at Twitter, NeuBible is a breath of fresh air in the, otherwise, stale landscape of bible related apps.

###NeuBible reimagined the ideal reading experience

The main incumbent, YouVersion, has pioneered much in connecting a mobile centric audience to the religious document. However, as the iOS eco-system matured away from skeuomorphic design, YouVersion remained stale. In an effort to maintain its broad appeal, they alienated the early adopters who made them successful in the first place.

It’s in this backdrop that NeuBible nonchalantly sidles onto the scene with all the humble magnificence we would associate with a Jony Ive delivery. Martin and Westerhold have not simply attempted to re-package the bible for a more design centric audience, they have re-imagined what the ideal reading experience should be for handheld devices. The simplicity of the app is reminiscent of the environments [Marco Arment](https://twitter.com/marcoarment "target="_blank) created with [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/ "target="_blank) and [The Magazine](http://the-magazine.org/ "target="_blank).

###Designed with larger devices in mind

It is clear to me the navigation of the app was specifically designed with larger devices in mind. The key areas of the app are all found in the lower quadrant of the screen and are all accessible through swiping gestures. To access search, you simply double-tap anywhere on the screen, bringing up the search bar and keyboard. This really is where the app shines. The speed at which the app gets you to the passage of scripture you’re interested in is sublime. Everything about the app has been designed to remove the obstacles that so often stand between you and the all important word of God. NeuBible also gives the reader enough customization for wider appeal with carefully selected options for typography, day and night, line height, and text size. They further provide different color palettes to update the feel of the app.

The one interface choice I’m curious about is navigating between chapters. This is achieved by swiping from right to left, revealing a vertical list of numbers. You can tap these numbers to get to a particular chapter, although the size of the numbers is a little small for an individual tap target. This is where it gets interesting. Holding down and dragging your finger along the numbers causes a teardrop to appear to the left with a much bigger number in it, releasing your finger navigates you to the chapter number you stopped on. Now, this all works great and I love the clean nature of the interaction. However, I’m right handed. I was randomly using my phone with my left hand and was attempting to navigate through chapters but my thumb almost entirely covered the teardrop callout, rendering it unreadable. Like I previously stated, I’m not a left handed user, so it doesn’t bother me in the slightest, but I’d be very interested to hear if there are any lefties who have found this to be an issue.

###Translations are for complainers

The main complaint from those critical of the app center around the number of translations available. At present, they are limited to: The World English Bible, American Standard Version, King James Version, and, for a $1.99 in-app purchase, the New American Standard Version. NeuBible stated new translations are coming in future releases, but for some this will be a prohibitive barrier in adopting the app. For my part, I understand the complaint, but the renewed joy I have when using the app to read the bible more than trumps the issue of translations. The experience the app provides is so superior to the other options currently available, it has instantly become the default bible app on my phone.

The reality is there are so many distractions in our day to day life and the medium we use to access this life-giving text should not be one of them. I only hope NeuBible’s momentum snowballs with the widespread adoption of the Christian community. Although, if nothing else, I hope the presence of NeuBible inspires other bible app developers to reconsider the importance of simplistic, user centric design as they seek to provide the bible to a mass audience.

So, if you haven’t already, go [download it ](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/neubible/id961857426?mt=8 "target="_blank) and give it a spin.
