title: Instagram's Confounding Update

Yesterday Instagram released a fairly minor update including emoji hashtags as well as 3 new filters. While these new features are cool, what I am most blown away by, is the redesign of the like, comment and more information buttons.

This may seem like an innocuous change, but I would seriously have loved to have been behind the scenes throughout the decision making process. If for nothing more than to understand how they reached this conclusion. The visual update to the buttons themselves is great, much simpler and cleaner; befitting of the overall trend of app interfaces moving towards utilitarianism. However, the buttons have now moved from beneath the comments of the post, to between the photo and the comments.

### New vs Old

I cannot comprehend the logic behind this change. To begin with, let’s take the like button; I’d wager the majority of people never use it, opting instead to simply double tap the photo. This makes sense with the photo being a much larger tap target. So, we’ve established there’s no real pressing need to move the like button.

Next, the more information button, now this one I could potentially see an argument for moving. If Facebook wanted to try and encourage more cross platform sharing, or wanted to further highlight the option to flag photos as inappropriate, then it would make sense to move it.

For me, the comment button should absolutely not have been moved. Any argument I can think of to move the other two buttons is trumped by the positional importance of the comment button.

### Interface touch targets
Since the advent of larger handheld devices, much has been made of the need to adapt navigation and major actionable elements away from the top of the screen and within easy reach of the user. For most people, reaching the upper quarter of the screen is uncomfortable, requiring a shifting of the way you hold the device in order to position your finger or thumb to reach it.

As an interface designer, you want your most used elements to be as accessible with as little friction as possible. By moving the comment button, Instagram has introduced more friction to the process of engaging with a post. The flow of information is as follows:

- View the photo.
- Double tap the image to like it.
- Read the caption.
- If you haven’t already, double tap the photo to like it.
- Start reading the comments
- If you feel so inclined, click the comment button to add your own.

For an average photo I’m now having to reach over a 1/3 of the screen from where my eye and my thumb is, in order to tap the comment button. Also, reducing the buttons to simply icons significantly reduces the overall width of the tap target. Whereas before the comment button sat just left of center, only a small movement away from where my thumb naturally hovers over the screen.

For a post with a large caption or a couple of loquacious comments it gets even worse. By the time I’ve scrolled down the page to read them, the comment button is completely gone. So now, not only am I having to reach an awkward target, I’m having to scroll back to find it.

### Will anybody really care?
Maybe this is all just nerd talk and, in practice, no one will care or even notice. However, given the ever decreasing attention span of the digital generation, I would not be at all surprised if Instagram sees a decrease in comments on photos. Expecting users to scroll around every time they want to comment on a friends post is just a bad experience, one that introduces unnecessary friction. I don’t know why Instagram felt like they needed to make this change, but as far as I can see, it is driven much more by aesthetics than usability.
