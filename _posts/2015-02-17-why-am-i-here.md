Well, that's a great question. Here is a brief explanation and, by way of introduction, detail of why this blog exists.

I used to write a lot when I was younger. From journaling to short stories and poetry to songs, it always seemed like I was writing something down. Since catching the entrepreneurial virus and getting sucked into the thrilling black hole of building products, any semblance of organized writing died a swift death. Lately, I've been taking a step back to re-evaluate what I'm doing, examine where my time is being spent, and work on new, useful disciplines. Coincidently, this includes starting up a blog.

Let me say, I, truly, appreciate you coming to visit this site. I hope you can leave having found something inspiring, encouraging, or informative. However, as selfish as it seems, this is, primarily, for my benefit. It is a tool for me to learn and grow. I don't profess to have profound, or even distinctly original, things to say. I suspect much of what I will end up writing could be found or gleaned somewhere else on the internet. This is, simply, a public outlet for me to grow in the discipline and regularity of writing; to detail and explain the process of what I discover, build, and learn.

Nevertheless, I do aspire, in some small way, to help you on your journey as I share the descriptions of mine.

### What to expect
At this early stage, I have a general, albeit foggy, idea of what this will look like over the coming weeks and months. My goal is to post once a week - we’ll see what happens! I’ll be, predominantly, writing about my journey as a UI/UX Designer; the projects I’m working on, the rationale behind the choices I made, things I’m learning along the way. Don’t be surprised to see a rant or two on seemingly unrelated topics! Also, I’m very much an audiophile, so I’ll be talking about the soundtrack to my learnings along the way.

Here’s to the journey, to the grand adventure, to a life of never-ending learning and, I hope, only a brief intermission until the next post!
