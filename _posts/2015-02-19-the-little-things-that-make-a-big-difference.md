Recently, I was working on a mockup of a Facebook cover photo for a client. In the process of researching what their competitors were doing and clicking around on Facebook, I made a curious discovery.

Now before I go any further, I feel it’s only fair to, briefly, disclose my thoughts on Facebook.

### Facebook is the devil in itself
Well, there it is. I don’t like Facebook. If you’re interested in more negative press about the social behemoth and why you should abandon it now, then read [here](http://saintsal.com/facebook/ "target="_blank) and [here](http://www.businessinsider.com/10-reasons-to-delete-your-facebook-account-2010-5 "target="_blank). For me, the reality is that Facebook ‘feels’ shady. Their brand has come to represent a necessary evil in the world I live in. I have zero faith in them to do the right thing, or to behave in a manner that values their users over the bottom line. Suffice to say, the fact I was impressed by something they had done was no small feat.

### The famous notifications globe
By now, we’re all familiar with Facebook’s globe icon, which represents our notifications - you know, the thing that alerts you when your distant cousin likes the cat video you just posted. As I was exploring the different [sprites](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_sprites.asp "target="_blank) Facebook uses on its site, I found they use, not one, but three different globe icons. The icon you see when you sign in to Facebook changes depending on where you are in the world.

This doesn’t seem like a particularly important, or ground breaking, design feature to comment on. However, it struck me as a detail many organizations would either never think of or simply overlook as not worth the resources to implement. Facebook is a global company, and ensuring its global audience feels at home on the platform is a big deal. Small gestures, such as the globe reflecting the region in which you reside, is the kind of attention to detail that set great products and companies apart. To design experiences that provide users with a a familiar context that enables them to fully utilize and feel comfortable with the product, is the ultimate goal.

There are many controversial things Facebook has done and will continue to do. Yet, I will applaud them for the care they take, in the incremental evolution of the product, to cater to their insanely large audience.


### Key take away
Creating cohesive experiences is hard. There are many times where conventional wisdom teaches us to simplify, to take away as much as possible until only what is truly useful remains. In the pursuit of a clean, spartan design, we can sometimes lose sight of the greater truth; we’re solving problems for real people and not every person is the same. Not every person is American. I want to make sure I do not shift my perspective so far toward the broad, impersonal brush strokes of ‘demographics’ and ‘conversions’, and forget about the individual people I’m creating for.

Sometimes, when you are a Facebook monster, you design three icons instead of one.
